Absolutely, the user interface (UI) of your app should directly align with its main objective of helping roommates split expenses and manage shared financial responsibilities. Keeping the UI simple, intuitive, and focused on the core purpose will enhance the user experience and make the app more effective. Here are some UI design principles and considerations to ensure your UI remains up to the point:

1. **Simplicity:** Keep the UI design clean and clutter-free. Avoid unnecessary elements or features that might distract from the primary objective.

2. **Clear Navigation:** Make it easy for users to navigate through the app. Use clear labels and intuitive icons for actions like adding expenses, viewing balances, and accessing settings.

3. **Focused Home Screen:** Design the home screen to immediately show users their shared balances and a summary of recent expenses. This provides quick access to the most relevant information.

4. **Quick Expense Entry:** Make adding expenses a straightforward process. Use a simple form where users can enter the amount, select a category, and specify who paid. A "split equally" option could be prominent.

5. **Real-Time Updates:** Ensure that the shared balances and expense breakdown are updated in real-time. This transparency helps roommates stay on top of their financial situation.

6. **Visual Clarity:** Use color coding or icons to differentiate between different expense categories. For instance, utilities could have a different color than groceries.

7. **Confirmation & Feedback:** Provide clear confirmation messages when expenses are added or payments are made. Positive feedback assures users that their actions were successful.

8. **Expense History:** Design a section where users can view their past expenses in a simple list or a clear timeline format. This helps users keep track of their financial history.

9. **Equity Options:** If you offer different splitting options (equal vs. proportional), make sure these options are easy to find and select.

10. **Roommate Communication:** If there's a chat or messaging feature, design it to be straightforward and easily accessible.

11. **Privacy & Security:** Emphasize the privacy and security features of the app to reassure users that their financial information is protected.

12. **Profile & Settings:** Keep user profiles and settings minimal, focusing only on what's necessary for the app's core purpose. Allow users to easily update their information and preferences.

13. **Mobile-Friendly:** Design with mobile devices in mind, as users are likely to access the app on their smartphones. Ensure a responsive design for different screen sizes.

14. **Help & Support:** Provide easily accessible help or FAQ sections for users who may have questions about how to use the app effectively.

Remember that a focused UI doesn't mean sacrificing aesthetics. You can still use appealing colors, typography, and visual elements to create a pleasant and engaging user experience while keeping the primary objective in mind. Continuously gather feedback from users to refine the UI and make sure it aligns with their needs and expectations.
